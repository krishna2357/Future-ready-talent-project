My project is about Developing a fashion Category Website 💭

It is useful for people with fashion products with reasonable price and good quality.
I hope every person wants to buy fashionable goods at a reasonable price , Providing that needs is my projects goal.
In Addition to this my website contains a health bot , it can be used to give precautions for your body symptoms to control the decease or any disabilities.


I Created My Project Using 2 Azure technologies, They Are 

1️⃣ Static Web Apps

2️⃣ Health Bot
