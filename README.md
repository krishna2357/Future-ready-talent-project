My project is about Developing a fashion Category Website for products with cheap price and good quality to help the people.


I Created My Project Using 2 Azure technologies, They Are 

1. Static Web Apps 
2. Visual Studio Code 

By Using Visual Studio Code I developed a page Using HTML as shown.

After Creating the Code For the webpage I uploaded the code to the empty github repository which i created for the project as shown.
